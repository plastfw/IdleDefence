## Overlap In One Line Of Code

#### Using

```csharp
using NTC.OverlapSugar;
```
#### Overlap Settings

```csharp
[SerializeField] private OverlapSettings overlapSettings;
```

#### For Single Target

```csharp
OverlapFinder.TryFind(overlapSettings, out IDamageable damageable);
```
```csharp
overlapSettings.TryFind(out IDamageable damageable);
```
#### For Many Targets

```csharp
private readonly List<IDamageable> _detectedDamageables = new List<IDamageable>(32);

OverlapFinder.TryFind(_detectedDamageables, overlapSettings);
```
```csharp
private readonly List<IDamageable> _detectedDamageables = new List<IDamageable>(32);

OverlapFinder.TryFindInChildren(_detectedDamageables, overlapSettings);
```

## Examples Of Using

`Example For Single Target:`

```csharp
    using NTC.OverlapSugar;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class UnitMeleeAttack : UnitAttack
    {
        [SerializeField] private OverlapSettings overlapSettings;

        public void TryPerformAttack()
        {
            if (overlapSettings.TryFind(out IDamageable damageable))
            {
                damageable.ApplyDamage(Damage);
            }
        }
    }
```

`Example For Many Targets:`

```csharp
    using NTC.OverlapSugar;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class UnitMeleeAttack : UnitAttack
    {
        [SerializeField] private OverlapSettings overlapSettings;

        public IReadOnlyList<IDamageable> DetectedDamageables => _detectedDamageables;

        private readonly List<IDamageable> _detectedDamageables = new List<IDamageable>(32);
        
        public void TryPerformAttack()
        {
            if (OverlapFinder.TryFind(_detectedDamageables, overlapSettings))
            {
                _detectedDamageables.ForEach(ApplyDamage);
            }
        }
        
        private void ApplyDamage(IDamageable damageable)
        {
            damageable.ApplyDamage(Damage);
        }
    }
```

## Draw Gizmos

`Also you can draw gizmos of overlap zone:`

```csharp
    public class UnitMeleeAttack : UnitAttack
    {
        [SerializeField] private OverlapSettings overlapSettings;

#if UNITY_EDITOR
        private void OnDrawGizmos()
        {
            overlapSettings.TryDrawGizmos();
        }
#endif
    }
```

or

```csharp
    public class UnitMeleeAttack : UnitAttack
    {
        [SerializeField] private OverlapSettings overlapSettings;

#if UNITY_EDITOR
        private void OnDrawGizmosSelected()
        {
            overlapSettings.TryDrawGizmos();
        }
#endif
    }
```
